# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my journey in learning JavaScript effectively. Inspired by the article [How to Learn JavaScript Effectively](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-javascript-effectively/) written by [Tapas Adhikary](https://www.tapasadhikary.com/). This space is where I'll document my short-term and long-term goals, objectives, and progress in the world of coding and software development.

## Short-Term Goal (By the end of November 2023)

### Goal 1: Mastering Fundamental Concepts
- [ ] **Objective 1:** Dive into basic programming concepts, building a strong foundation.
